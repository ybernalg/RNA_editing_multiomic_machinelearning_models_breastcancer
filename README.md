RNA Editing Multiomic Machine Learning Models for Breast Cancer
This repository contains the code and resources needed to reproduce analyses conducted as part of the research project focusing on A>I(G) RNA editing and its impact on the response to genotoxic drugs in breast cancer, leveraging multi-omics approaches and machine learning models.

Project Description
The main objective of this project is to explore the relationship between RNA editing and therapy response in breast cancer patients. By integrating transcriptomic, genomic, and clinical data, machine learning models are developed to identify RNA editing patterns potentially linked to resistance or sensitivity to treatments.


Key Components of the Project:
- Preprocesing: gene expression, RNA edited sites, tumoral and germline DNA with their visualization.
- Machine Learning Models: Implementation of classification models, including GLM, Random Forest, and SVM with LASSO and PCA strategies for selection of variables with differents omics combinations; and Performance metrics F1-score and AUC ROC curve.
- Score of risk:  considering features from final model ML, we generate a score of risk of non-response to therapy.
